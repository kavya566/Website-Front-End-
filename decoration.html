<p><h3 >Decorations in Indian weddings have surpassed the typical standards of simple hanging or scrunched up drapes and cliched floral arrangements
a long time back. With constant newness brimming up and creative minds of wedding decorators curating unique and fresh trends, 
Indian wedding decorations have evolved multi folds over the years. And quite amazingly, there's no going back now! From amping up even 
the tiniest of elements of the decor to centering it around a set theme entirely, simple Indian wedding decoration ideas have undoubtedly been
taken a notch higher! </h3></p>
<p><h3 >One particular aspect of wedding decor that's certainly been fashioned over the years to stand out amongst the rest is the wedding stage. 
What started off as setting a sofa against a floral backdrop on a carpeted stage (typically red) has now bloomed up to be one of the fanciest
highlights of wedding decor and how! From surreal and minimal quaint ones to enormous princely ones, the vast spectrum of wedding stage decoration 
has a lot to offer and we're all spoilt for choices.
If like us, you too have a thing for those exquisite and fancy wedding stages and would love to incorporate them at your wedding, 
you've landed in the right place. </h3></p>
